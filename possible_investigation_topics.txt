- Hardening (Saturation function) verbessern aufgrund Kristallographie (z.B. Scherwinkel zu Gleitsystem)
important: We want martensite that forms by means of shear, i.e. the theory should be used to identify potential
shear systems.

- Interaction matrix: Eshelbys inclusion theory, Madangopal, DSA method  --- see Books of Mura bzw. Rob Phillips

- Investigate change of solutions for habit planes a(T) for a material as a function of temperature for steel
How does the temperature dependence of the lattice parameter influence the habit planes from a purely matching point of view 
(no diffusion considered). could be constant but could be not!
  Especially calculate roational direction of habit-plane.
